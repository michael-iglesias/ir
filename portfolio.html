              <br>Using PHP/CodeIgniter we created an Ecommerce site with Facebook/Twitter/OpenTok integration. College roommates are able to shop via live video chat and split the cost at the end of the process. Users are able to register and log into the
              site using their Facebook or Twitter account.</p>

              <br>Job Posting Site which allows Job Seekers to create very detailed Profile pages. Job searchers can upload video footage of themselves and audio recordings to give valuable first impressions. Facebook Connect/Twitter Authentication integration
              is another feature that makes this site user friendly. Site can also securely process payemnts(PayPal Integration) to allow Employers to purchase job postings. User dashboard is Ajax driven giving the website a native desktop feel.</p>

              <br>It's always a blast working with young motivated Startups. During this project we helped integrate Facebook Connect, along with incorporating other Facebook sharing features. We worked extensively on optimizing the site and it's performance.
              We also created a custom 'Time Availability Picker' powered by jQuery which would update it's records asynchronously. We adjusted and corrected several design issues throughout the site, as well as the search engine allowing users to search
              other users registered on the site. The site is powered by custom OOP PHP &amp; PEAR. Technologies like Javascript, jQuery, and CSS3 can be found throughout the entire site.</p>

              <br>Prudential was having several issues with it's Sencha Touch powered mobile site. We therefore, corrected these issues along with adding additional features and making their desktop site transparent to mobile viewers.</p>

            <br>Throughout this project we worked extensively with Facebook's API, integrating Facebook login and Facebook event creation. We also used jQuery extensively to create a better user experience by redesigning the sites 'Search' interface along
            with several other things. We made some notable changes in the back-end giving site-admins better control over the site and it's content. The site is built on the CodeIgniter Framework, and technologies like jQuery, YUI, CSS3, and HTML 5.</p>
